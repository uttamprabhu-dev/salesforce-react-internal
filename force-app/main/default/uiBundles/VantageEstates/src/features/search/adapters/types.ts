/**
 * Kind-agnostic adapter contracts for unified (multi-source) search.
 *
 * Every searchable backend ("sobject", "cms", …) is fronted by a
 * {@link SourceAdapter}. The core query builder and result parser are
 * completely kind-agnostic: they dispatch to the adapter registered for a
 * source's `kind`, so a new backend plugs in by adding a `kind` + an adapter,
 * never by touching the common builder/parser or any consumer.
 *
 *  - {@link SourceAdapter.buildRequest} contributes a {@link QueryFragmentContribution}
 *    (its GraphQL fragment, variable declarations, and variable values) that the
 *    builder assembles into one combined document.
 *  - {@link SourceAdapter.parseResponse} receives the full response `data` root
 *    and extracts this source's `SourceResult`, returning `null` (never
 *    throwing) when its own subtree is absent or errored — this is what lets
 *    sources fail independently (partial-failure resilience).

/**

 * The builder concatenates every source's `variableDeclarations` into the
 * `query Search(...)` header and merges every source's `variables` into one
 * flat map. Fragments are placed by `placement`:
 *   - `"uiapi.query"` → inside the shared `uiapi { query { … } }` block.
 *   - `"root"`        → a sibling of `uiapi` at the document root (e.g. the CMS
 *     `managed_content { … }` block).
 *
 * A contribution MAY declare zero extra variables (e.g. the CMS bootstrap call
 * omits `$cmsContentTypeFQNs` entirely). The builder handles declaration lists of
 * differing lengths, so an unused/undeclared variable is never emitted.
